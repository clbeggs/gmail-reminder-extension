<h1>Small Firefox Extension to help remind to attach files to emails for those who have "detail oriented" listed under their skills on their resume, but forget to attach their resume..</h1>


Recently I attended a job fair, after perservering through all of the hard work 
of revising my Resume, making sure my GitHub was all up to date, and humble bragging to
strangers, I went home to send follow up emails as most attendees do.

Over the next couple of hours, I tailor made an email for each person I talked too,
explaining why I would be a good fit on their team. Then I hit send on the last email.
*PHEW* all done with, now its time to study for-- AH! I forgot to attach my Resume to
each of the emails... And I ended each one with "Attached below is my Resume .."

Worst. Feeling. Ever. 

Hopefully they won't notice I listed "Detail Oriented" under my skills...

After realizing my mistake, I went through the painstaking and embarrising process of
replying to the email with my Resume, triple checking that it's attached each time.

The horror!! Not minutes after this I sat down to write this.

It may not be pretty but golly is is visible.
